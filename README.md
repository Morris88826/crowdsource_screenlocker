# Crowdsource Screenlocker
# Introduction & Problems
Google Crowdsource is an app that invites users to contribute to the building blocks of artificial intelligence to help improve the performance of Google products. However, it is undeniable that Crowdsource lacks incentives to attract new users. Also, the labeling system is not appealing enough or too plain and tiring so 
that it cannot retain the users. Therefore, we listed out some pain points before optimizing the user experience.

**Incentives:** 
Crowdsource has its rewarding system currently, but it takes too long for a user to reach the goal. Moreover, being announced as a great contributor is only attractive to a limited number of users. 

**Setting Function:**
While Crowdsource provides different functionalities so that users can set up on their behalf, it is considered difficult or troublesome to find that setting button. 

**User Friendly:** 
Crowdsource pops up with a “do you want to continue” prompt after users have conducted several labeling. However, it would be annoying since the users can stop whenever they want to, and they do not need a reminder. Also, there is still room for improvement when users have to click “yes” or “no” bottom to label.

**Customer Loyalty:** 
Once a user of Crowdsource becomes wearied of labeling, there is no chance to have them back. Continually labeling without any stimulations is often regard as unadorned. Furthermore, there is no “quit” bottom for users to stop labeling when they are tired of it. Users often face a set of questions and only get that “do you want to continue” prompt when they finished a certain number of questions. However, customer’s patience is always a key to loyalty when it comes to applications.

### Solutions (Refer to Appendix for Full Structure Notes and Demonstration)

**Open Data Source Platform:**
Since Crowdsource is designed to enhance the performance of google products by making users perfect its dataset, we will suggest creating an open data source platform so that when a user reaches some level, they will be able to have access to some limited amount of data. It is reasonable when Google asks customers to label data, and give them some datasets as a return. In addition, some users come across Crowdsource to learn how the dataset works along with a machine learning model, and we believe it can be a reliable incentive to attract new users and encourage current users to make more contributions. 

**Swipe Right:** 
Take the image verification problem as an example, the image is displayed in the middle of the page where you can tap on the “yes” or “no” bottom to label or “skip” bottom to continue without labeling. However, we suggest making the operation easier and more friendly. enabling users to swipe right for yes, swipe left for no, and swipe up to skip.

**Crowdsource Lock Screen:** 
As mentioned in the previous sector, continuous labeling can lead to customer fatigue. We suggest adding functionality so that users can set crowdsource as their lock screen. Users can decide which type of problems to be set as the lock screen, and the question will be displayed before the password screen. It takes merely a few seconds to unlock your smartphone and answer a question with a single swipe. Modern people unlock their phones about 80 times a day on average. It is difficult to ask users to label 80 questions a day, but it will be a lot easier for users to solve one question at a time, and 80 times a day. Besides, move “setting” to the home page so that it is more user-friendly.

### Analysis & Expected Performance
**Statistics**
According to Statista Research Department, the average number of unlocks per day among smartphones for Gen-Z users in the United States as of August 2018 is 79 times. Referring to Internet Trends, smartphone owners unlock their phones 150 times on average per day. Also, some studies elucidate that Americans check their phone every 12 minutes, and 10% of them check their phone once every 4 minutes. Besides, Elite Content Marketer mentioned that most people spend roughly 1 minute 15 seconds on their phone once they pick it up. 

**Analysis and Expected Outcome**
Statistics have shown that most smartphone users have the following habits:
1. Unlock their phones a lot of times a day.
2. Spending no more than 3 minutes at a time when they unlock their screen.

There are many interesting gaming applications for smartphones that appeal to the customers, and that there is no way that Crowdsource can compete. Instead of thinking of a way to make users stick to the app for 20 minutes to solve dozens of works, following users’ habits can lead to better success. 

While open data source platforms can create incentives to attract AI researchers or students in the related field, swiping function can optimize the user experience and increase efficiency so that users will be able to conduct more questions in the same amount of time. In addition, moving the setting bottom to the home page lets users set up the preference easier. Last but not least, encouraging users to set crowdsource as lock screen can dramatically increase the number of questions labeled a day while users may not even notice it.
